//make a j.son file

// Word of the day: 
//each day at 12:00AM, pick a random number
//random number * length of json file list
//whatever that number is - display that number term, definition, and example on the page. 
//eg. random number is 9, so display the 9th term and its info

// Translator:
//create text user input
// Loooooooong conditional with all the terms and their respective info
// If user input is ___, the definition is ___ and example is ____. 
// If user input = term[0], the definition is definition[0] and example is example[0]. 
// Is there any way to do this with the j.son file? 
//Look up the word in the json file, find the corresponding definition and example. 

// Glossary: 
//loop through each set of header, definition and example.
//term[0]
//definition[0]
//example[0]
//etc.

//jk nvm
//loop through each set of terms, display that on the page.
//if the user clicks on a specific term, term[i], then add definition[i], and exmaple etc. 
//basically have all the terms - and if that term is opened, display corresponding info 
//maybe make a template in html, and have it be visible vs not 
//create list
//add list items - title, def, ex
//when list title is clicked, add 2 more list items 
//is there a pop up with the definition?
